The other person of the correspondence is a unkown person, only signing as 'V.D.'. They demand the tunnel to be large enough for a wagon to pass through, and that it must be finished quickly. Shortly after construction started, it became clear that the tunnel would not be finished in time, and the royalist demanded that the tunnel be made smaller. In response, 'V.D.' sent them an item that would help them finish the tunnel faster, a {@item Sphere of Annihilation|XDMG}. The royalist were horrified by the item, but 'V.D.' assured them that it was safe to use, as long as they followed the instructions laid out by the provider of the item, a person named 'Terick'. The first correspondence is dated a few days after the initial attack on Ascalon. The last one is dated 2 weeks ago. ",

Inside are the remains of a camp, long abandoned. A few rusted tools and a tattered journal remain. The journal belonged to a miner who worked on the tunnel, and it details the hardships they faced, including cave-ins and attacks by strange creatures. The last entry is dated two weeks ago, and it mentions that they were close to finishing the tunnel when they were forced to abandon it due to an attack by unknown assailants. Similar camps can be found every 3000 meters or so. After the change of style, the camps become cleanly carved and no longer have tools or journals."

Whole cities and guilds were destroyed in the Searing, and the might of Ascalon was shattered. Now the Great Northern Wall lies broken, and the Charr have overrun much of the kingdom, defiling it with their unholy shrines, killing those who stand in their way.",
                "The survival of Ascalon hinges on but a single remaining corner of the fallen kingdom—the capital city of Rin. In the final years of the last Guild War, the people of Rin looked to a soldier named Adelbern, a simple man of humble origins, who rallied the people with his courage and cunning and steeled them not only against the guilds of Orr and Kryta but also against the terrors of the Charr.",
                "The sudden destruction of most of the kingdom during the Searing has taken much of the fight out of the man now known as King Adelbern. He has become stubborn and set in his ways, afraid of losing what little he has left. But in his son Rurik, the people see a leader with the courage to perhaps help them reclaim their fallen kingdom.",
                "The survivors of Ascalon live in a state of constant warfare, using hit-and-run tactics and the remnants of the Great Wall to prevent any significant advances by the Charr into their territory. King Adelbern has circled the wagons, so to speak, content to simply defend what Ascalon has left and live to fight another day. Prince Rurik, on the other hand, is far more daring than his father thinks is wise, and has even suggested that the time may be coming to launch an offensive against the Charr.",
                "Already the rumbling of the winds of change can be heard in the streets. People are frightened. They wonder what will become of them. Some even wonder aloud if Adelbern has lost what it takes to steer Ascalon back from the brink. They wish to see the prince step up and take command of the kingdom. Perhaps under his guidance, the people of Ascalon will live on to see another golden age."
