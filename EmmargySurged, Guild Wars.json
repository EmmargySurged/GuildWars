This was perhaps, to be expected, given their never-ending war against the aggressive Charr. Indeed, it was their unfailing vigilance, their Great Northern Wall, and the blood they shed each year to defend it that had protected not only Ascalon, but also Kryta and Orr through the ages.",
				"Then came the invasion, and with it, the Searing. ",
				"Anyone alive today will remember the day the lands of Ascalon were blasted and torn with magic fire. Whole cities and guilds were destroyed in the Searing, and the might of Ascalon was shattered. Now the Great Northern Wall lies broken, and the Charr have overrun much of the kingdom, defiling it with their unholy shrines, killing those who stand in their way.",
				"The survival of Ascalon hinges on but a single remaining corner of the fallen kingdom—the capital city of Rin. In the final years of the last Guild War, the people of Rin looked to a soldier named Adelbern, a simple man of humble origins, who rallied the people with his courage and cunning and steeled them not only against the guilds of Orr and Kryta but also against the terrors of the Charr.",
				"The sudden destruction of most of the kingdom during the Searing has taken much of the fight out of the man now known as King Adelbern. He has become stubborn and set in his ways, afraid of losing what little he has left. But in his son Rurik, the people see a leader with the courage to perhaps help them reclaim their fallen kingdom.",
				"The survivors of Ascalon live in a state of constant warfare, using hit-and-run tactics and the remnants of the Great Wall to prevent any significant advances by the Charr into their territory. King Adelbern has circled the wagons, so to speak, content to simply defend what Ascalon has left and live to fight another day. Prince Rurik, on the other hand, is far more daring than his father thinks is wise, and has even suggested that the time may be coming to launch an offensive against the Charr.",
				"Already the rumbling of the winds of change can be heard in the streets. People are frightened. They wonder what will become of them. Some even wonder aloud if Adelbern has lost what it takes to steer Ascalon back from the brink. They wish to see the prince step up and take command of the kingdom. Perhaps under his guidance, the people of Ascalon will live on to see another golden age."

From there, merchant ships travel to Istan's numerous islands and the Kournan mainland, braving waters troubled by corsair patrols, cyclones, and greater dangers. Valiant Istani watch the waters, confident that when hostile outsiders arrive in Elona, the province’s citizens, soldiers, and sailors will be ready for them.",
				"Great Istani heroes have been forged by great adversity: war, famine, invasion, and stranger threats. Over six hundred years ago, the infamous Scarab Plague devastated this province. Victims died horribly, as insects erupted through boils on their skin. Many believed the outbreak of plague had supernatural origins, blaming the suffering of the innocent on unseen forces. In this troubled time, heroes tended to the sick, evacuated towns and villages, and searched for the source of corruption. Though the origin of the plague was never found, great tales are still told of heroes helping the beleaguered populace.",
				"To this day, Istan rewards bravery and accomplishment. No word describes its government more than 'meritocracy': the best and brightest are rewarded with promotion, and years of service are recognized. Village elders watch over many towns and outposts, eventually rising to positions of respect and authority on the Council of Elders. The province has its fair share of miscreants and scoundrels, of course—criminals typically sink to the dregs of society—but each dawn in Istan, another hero’s journey begins."

Inspired by his example, Kournans revere loyalty, patriotism, a strong sense of duty, and dedication to military service. Not every Kournan is a soldier, but farmers laboring in the fields and crafters slaving in workshops know the value of a safe and secure province. The strength of the state depends on loyalty to its leaders. Pacified Centaur laborers add to the province’s muscle. Typical Kournan dedication drives citizens to work hard for prosperity—in fact, the entire nation relies on the province’s agriculture and handiwork. Kournan adventurers go to war secure in the knowledge that their swords are well-tempered and their armor well-made, forged as surely as the soldiers who wield them."

In 1072 AE, late into the Season of the Scion, he tricks the players into opening the Door of Komalie at the Ring of Fire Island Chain, setting free the Titans which he then controls using the scepter, and reveals his second, new identity. The Cataclysm did not spare him, but instead transformed him into the Undead Lich.",

Scholars debate whether a Charr victory in Orr would have been preferable to the nation's complete destruction, or that, under the circumstances, the Vizier could have made no other decision, and that the outcome of the spell could not have been foreseen.",

				"The Norn are a race of nine-foot-tall warriors who live in the northernmost Shiverpeaks. They revel in the harsh climes, leading dangerous lives among savage beasts. These mighty hunters are not organised into a single nation. Instead, those who display exceptional strength and prowess in battle establish homesteads, though they are certainly not considered 'rulers'. They often spend years at a time tracking a particularly strong or clever quarry; they never give up on a battle, a pursuit, or a friend.",
				"The Norn revere the spirits of nature—from the wolf to the snow lynx -- but the most powerful of these is the Bear Spirit, who, according to myth, blessed the Norn with the ability to change shape and 'become the bear'.",
				"A race of shape-shifting half-giants from the north, the Norn value personal strength, victory, and purifying the soul through battle. They revere the spirits of animals and call on them like shamans.",
				"The Norn are a highly independent race with a fighter-centric society, holding strength and prowess in combat above everything else. To a Norn, the greatest shame is not dying in battle, but rather not having the tale of their life, especially death, told. Due to their independence, the Norn are hardly seen in large parties with the exception of great hunts, festivities, and in the larger homesteads like Gunnar's Hold.",
				"For the Norn, in order to wed, the couple must be of equal reputation, and marriage symbolises the combining of their tales. During the wedding, someone must speak on the behalf of the two to show their worth for the other.",
				"Norn culture is highly individualistic with a focus on personal success and glory—particularly when gained from the hunt or in a battle. The norn do not fear death as they believe the bold and strong can achieve immortality, but they do fear they will be weak and end up forgotten. As a result each norn seeks to prove themselves, to build their legend through feats of individual valour and great victories. Every norn hopes their legend will be told by the skaald and celebrated at a moot with story and song. Norn usually have a great sense of personal honour, for a norn without respect from others is already forgotten. For many norn, the focus on prestige means they're willing to accept any challenge which will prove their worth. They will never give up on their battle, quarry or friends, even if it means years spent tackling a strong enemy or difficult task. Yet for other norn the pursuit of prestige translates to bragging, bullying, unwise snap decisions and an unwillingness to listen to reason.",
				"Norn are a hearty, proud people—quick to anger, but also to forgive. They are, by their nature, a race of optimists, keeping a positive outlook even though they have been driven from their homelands. A setback is seen as just another challenge to overcome. They respect those who can best them in a fight so brawling among norn is common. Drinking alcohol, often to excess, is also a large part of norn culture. Being drunk and fighting is not an uncommon combination, for example, norn alemoots feature competitions of 'skill' which require the competitors to be very drunk to compete.",
				"A norn might proudly trace their worthy ancestors through many generations and may pass a common name through a family (such as Olaf Olafson, seventh son of Olaf) but a great ancestry and family connections do not grant automatic respect to a norn. Everyone is judged not by their lineage or associated group but by what deeds they have done. There is no such thing as infamy to the norn; they are often tolerant of an individual to whom other races might treat with hostility by association."

In some cases Raven is believed to personally come to take the life of a norn who was about to die and guide the soul to the Mists.",

He only views someone unworthy in his eyes if the person does not learn from their mistakes, and he rewards the clever, the sincere, and those who seek out new experiences such as travelling the world. Although Raven represents the facets of mind that grant beings the vision to see and the wisdom to understand, his teachings also contain a darker side which some of his wayward shamans would cruelly embrace in their quest for knowledge and power at the expense of others."

During this time, open conflicts raged between the various human guilds and are now referred to as the Guild Wars. The Guild Wars were so widespread that they drew the Tyrian human kingdoms into war with each other in order to stop the battling in their own streets. It took the foreign threat of Charr to finally bring an end to the internecine conflict.

While Ascalon, Orr, and Kryta were busy fighting with each other, they became blind to the threat from the north—the Charr.",

From 100 BE, the kingdom was ruled alongside Ascalon by King Doric until his death in 1BE. Orr gained its independence in the year 2 AE. At the time of the Second Great Corsair War and King Zoran's reign, Orrian territory is known to have extended into the Tarnished Coast, and included the caverns now known as the Shards of Orr. Orr was once the most vibrant, proud, and prosperous human nation in the known world. Its citizens believed themselves to be the favoured of the Six Human Gods, living in the shadows of Arah which was once inhabited by the gods themselves.

				"The Flame Legion is one of the four High Legions of the Charr. The Flame Legion is renowned for its members' magical prowess and is most commonly associated with the Shaman caste.",
				"To the Charr, flame is the physical representation of their gods. In order to keep the gods happy, they must first fulfil their obligation to the flame. To that end, the Charr have constructed a series of sacred buildings known as Flame Temples. On raised platforms, these bestial creatures have inscribed huge circular runes, which define and magically feed the sacred fires. Further defining the ring are pillars of pure obsidian or carved sandstone, sculpted to depict the faces of the mysterious creatures the Charr worship. Between these pillars, in the very centre of each of these temples, are the ever-burning Sacred Flames. The Charr believe that as long as the flames are burning, the gods are pleased. If the flames go out, then the Charr have failed in their duties and will be punished by the gods.",
				"Each temple has its own fire, which is tended at all times by four Charr Flame Keepers. The Flame Keepers have only one job—to keep the Sacred Flame burning. This is the most prestigious position a Charr can occupy; only the strongest, most capable Charr can take this honour, and all other Charr bow to the Flame Keepers.",
				"In addition to the temples, whenever a large Charr warband travels anywhere, they take with them a bronze brazier, lit at a Flame Temple by the Sacred Flame. These braziers are placed upon palanquins, which are then carried from location to location by four Charr Flame Carriers. Each night when they make camp, the Flame Carriers erect a flammable effigy in the shape of one of their gods, then ignite it and let it burn till daylight."

Over time the dwarves laid claim to the Shiverpeak Mountains, forming the Deldrimor nation. Though they traded with the human nations and were on generally good terms, the dwarves largely kept to themselves.",
				"Sometime years prior to 1072 AE, Dagnar Stonepate, cousin to the ruling king, Jalis Ironhammer, created a splinter faction that opposed the Deldrimor. The Stone Summit was a group of xenophobic radicals who believed that it was the Dwarves' right to rule over all other races. Inevitably the friction between the two groups erupted into a civil war.",
				"The Dwarves are a mining and smithing centric society with a monarchy.",
				"Most of the Dwarves follow and worship the Great Dwarf as their creator and god. Outside of their creation legend, it is said that the Great Dwarf taught the Dwarves the fineness of crafting before he departed to the Great Forge, where all Dwarves go when they die. There are also dwarves who worship, or at least revere, Dwayna, Grenth, or the Great Destroyer. The dwarves who worship or revere Dwayna and Grenth only seem to appear during Wintersday. Many within the Stone Summit worship the Great Destroyer.",
				"There is also a group of Dwarves within Deldrimor known as the Brotherhood of the Dragon who serve the oracle dragon Glint."
