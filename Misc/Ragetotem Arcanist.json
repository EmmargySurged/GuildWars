				"You have learned to channel your spiritual energy through your totem to cast spells from it. See 2024 PHB chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as a Ragetotem Arcanist.",
				"{@bold Cantrips.} You know three cantrips: {@spell Mending|XPHB} and two other cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list (see that class's section for its list). {@spell Starry Wisp|XPHB} and {@spell Spare the Dying|XPHB} are recommended. Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except {@spell Mending|XPHB}, with another Druid cantrip of your choice. When you reach Barbarian level 10, you learn another Druid cantrip of your choice.",
				"{@bold Spell Slots.} You can expend your totems charges (no action required) to convert them into spell slots in the moment of casting, equal to the number of charges expended up to a maximum as shown in the Charge Limit column of the Ragetotem Arcanist table.",
				"{@bold Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level.} You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Druid spells. {@spell Cure Wounds}, {@spell Speak with Animals} and {@spell Thunderwave} are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Barbarian levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ragetotem Arcanist Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Druid spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ragetotem Arcanist Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you can generate spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Barbarian, your list of prepared spells can include five Druid spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.",
				"{@bold Changing Your Prepared Spells.} Whenever you gain a Barbarian level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Druid spell for which you can generate spell slots.",
				"{@bold Spellcasting Ability.} Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.",
				"{@bold Spellcasting Focus.} You use your totem as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.",
				"{@bold Rage.} You can casts spells while raging, but only through your totem. Casting a spell through the totem while raging counts as one of the actions you can take to extend it's duration.",
				"{@bold Concentration.} When you cast as spell which requires concentration, while raging, your totem is concentrating on the spell instead of you. Any features which apply changes to concentration to you are applied to your totem instead.",
				"{@bold Spell Origin.} When you cast a spell while raging, the totem casts the spell for you, using your spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The spell originates from the totem and the totem is the caster. When the totem casts a spell with a range of self, you can increased the range to touch, but it can only target you.",
				"{@bold Components.} When you cast a spell through your totem, any components, except material components with a specified cost, are provided by your totem. You must provide components with a cost as normal. Vocal components are provided by the chanting of ancestral spirits. Somatic components are provided by complex movements of the totem. Non-costed material components are provided by them appearing as ghostly images around the totem."
