				"The Desolation is situated on the northwestern portion of Elona, connected to the Crystal Desert. It is one of the most hostile regions on Tyria due to its sulfurous sands. It is riddled with poisonous sulfur deserts and is home to many undead creatures and the great Junundu wurms. The land was once under the rule of Palawa Joko but following his imprisonment the undead armies have gone through schisms and formed smaller groups. ",
				"The Desolation was once the coast of the Crystal Sea, and described as being a 'valley of verdant growth.' It was here that Abaddon was cast down by the other gods and banished into the Realm of Torment. His fall shattered and poisoned the land, turning it into what it is now. As the place where he was cast down, the Desolation is the part of Tyria closest to the Realm of Torment and it has begun to leak through and twist the already damaged lands."

				"The island province of Istan is known for its navy — a formidable fleet that patrols Elona's western coastline. Each day, ships from Tyria, Cantha, and other distant parts of the world arrive in the port city of Kamadan. From there, merchant ships travel to Istan's numerous islands and the Kournan mainland, braving waters troubled by corsair patrols, cyclones, and greater dangers. Valiant Istani watch the waters, confident that when hostile outsiders arrive in Elona, the province’s citizens, soldiers, and sailors will be ready for them.",
				"Great Istani heroes have been forged by great adversity: war, famine, invasion, and stranger threats. Over six hundred years ago, the infamous Scarab Plague devastated this province. Victims died horribly, as insects erupted through boils on their skin. Many believed the outbreak of plague had supernatural origins, blaming the suffering of the innocent on unseen forces. In this troubled time, heroes tended to the sick, evacuated towns and villages, and searched for the source of corruption. Though the origin of the plague was never found, great tales are still told of heroes helping the beleaguered populace.",
				"To this day, Istan rewards bravery and accomplishment. No word describes its government more than 'meritocracy': the best and brightest are rewarded with promotion, and years of service are recognized. Village elders watch over many towns and outposts, eventually rising to positions of respect and authority on the Council of Elders. The province has its fair share of miscreants and scoundrels, of course—criminals typically sink to the dregs of society—but each dawn in Istan, another hero’s journey begins."

				"The province of Kourna is eternally ready for war. Military historians analyze the great battles that have taken place here: the epic conflicts of Primeval Kings, the desperate efforts to unite the land in the Shattered Dynasty Era, and of course, Turai Ossa’s defeat of Palawa Joko near the Grand Cataract at Jahai. For centuries, Kourna has had a military government, and its leaders have been direct descendents of Warmarshal Turai Ossa. Inspired by his example, Kournans revere loyalty, patriotism, a strong sense of duty, and dedication to military service. Not every Kournan is a soldier, but farmers laboring in the fields and crafters slaving in workshops know the value of a safe and secure province. The strength of the state depends on loyalty to its leaders. Pacified Centaur laborers add to the province’s muscle. Typical Kournan dedication drives citizens to work hard for prosperity—in fact, the entire nation relies on the province’s agriculture and handiwork. Kournan adventurers go to war secure in the knowledge that their swords are well-tempered and their armor well-made, forged as surely as the soldiers who wield them."

As punishment for their evil deeds and corruption by Abaddon, the Lich Lord and Shiro Tagachi were also sent here.",

As Abaddon works towards Nightfall, the Realm of Torment and the world of the living draw ever closer until parts of the two begin to intermingle as the fabric of reality weakens."

Its provincial government, the Grand Forum of Vabb, is a plutocracy: only the wealthiest princes in the land have the power to make laws. Their legislature is openly democratic, but secretly, a merchant with influence has more power than a councilor with one vote.",
				"Vabbian princes rule the land. Most plutocrats sponsor great festivals and celebrations to display their importance and influence. Celebrations in Vabbian estates are wonders to behold: Dancers flourish in their elegant fashions, gourmands sample cuisine, revelers consume epic quantities of alcohol, and cultured citizens enjoy great works of drama and poetry. Heroes are welcomed at these festivals, where their heroism is celebrated in songs and stories.",
				"The Vabbi are effusive in displays of self-importance, but also keenly aware of how much they depend on other Elonians. The guards of Vabbian estates watch the mountain range to the north, while citizens on the province's southern border depend on neighboring Kournans to keep them safe. Outside the walls of the grand estates, danger is everywhere. Raiders know secret passes through the mountains and mines, and monstrous creatures roam the landscape. Fortunately, every generation of Vabbi includes idealists who dream of adventurous journeys across Elona. New tales of adventure appear on the shelves of Vabbi's libraries each year, as actors portray new heroes on the stages of Vabbian theaters."
