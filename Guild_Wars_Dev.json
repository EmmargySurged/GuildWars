When he is freed, he beseeches the player character to find and kill the Ice Drake. He is soon captured again on the path to the Frost Gate while trying to steal the Stone Summit's Secret Siege Weapon Plans. He is left in a dryder cave, and when rescued he enlists the player character's help to steal the plans, and repairs a Stone Summit ballista to blast open the gate protecting them.",

According to old tales, Owl taught Wolf how his hunting would be for naught if his family dined alone, making Wolf heed Owl's wisdom as he returned to his cubs. Although in some cases Raven was believed to personally come to take the life of a norn who was about to die and guide the soul to the Mists, Wolf was also known to do the same to people who walked in his footsteps."

In 1072 AE, late into the Season of the Scion, he tricks the players into opening the Door of Komalie at the Ring of Fire Island Chain, setting free the Titans which he then controls using the scepter, and reveals his second, new identity. The Cataclysm did not spare him, but instead transformed him into the Undead Lich.",

Scholars debate whether a Charr victory in Orr would have been preferable to the nation's complete destruction, or that, under the circumstances, the Vizier could have made no other decision, and that the outcome of the spell could not have been foreseen.",

The specter of Jutu later reveals that Khilbron was not simply coerced into using the magic but had also been converted to the worship of Abaddon prior to the Cataclysm. "
